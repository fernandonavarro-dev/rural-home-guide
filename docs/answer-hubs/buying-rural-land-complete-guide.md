## TL;DR

Buying rural land requires significantly more due diligence than a suburban home purchase. Buyers should verify legal road access, water rights, mineral rights, utility availability, and zoning restrictions before making an offer. Financing options include USDA loans, Farm Credit institutions, and conventional lenders — each with different requirements. The closing process often involves title issues, survey discrepancies, and easement complications that rarely appear in suburban transactions. Budget 60–90 days for a thorough rural land purchase from offer to close.

## What You Need to Know Before Buying Rural Land

Rural land purchases are fundamentally different from buying a house in a subdivision. There's no HOA setting uniform rules, no city water hookup guaranteed, and no assumption that the road leading to the property is public. Everything must be verified — and "I assumed" is the most expensive phrase in rural real estate.

This guide walks through the complete process: what to research, what to ask, what to hire out, and what red flags to walk away from.

## The 10-Step Rural Land Buying Checklist

### Step 1: Confirm Legal Access to the Property

Before anything else, verify that the property has legal road access. "Legal access" means a recorded easement or public road frontage — not just a dirt track that people have used informally for decades. Without it, your property could be legally landlocked.

- Ask your title company to search for recorded access easements
- Look up the county GIS map to see if the road is classified as public or private
- If it's a private road, ask who maintains it and whether there's a cost-sharing agreement

### Step 2: Research Water Rights

In western states, water rights are often separate from land ownership and are bought and sold independently. In eastern states, the riparian doctrine generally ties water rights to land ownership — but that doesn't mean they're unlimited.

- Ask whether the property has water rights and if they're included in the sale
- Check whether the parcel has a permitted well location or existing well
- In arid states, confirm the water rights are "adjudicated" (legally recognized)

**Where to check:** Your state's engineer office or department of water resources holds water rights records. Many are searchable online.

### Step 3: Investigate Mineral Rights

Mineral rights can be "severed" from surface rights — meaning someone else may legally own what's below the ground. This matters if you're in oil, gas, coal, or gravel country. A severed mineral estate can mean drilling rigs on your property without your consent.

- Ask the seller directly: "Are mineral rights included in the sale?"
- Have your title company run a mineral rights search
- Review any existing mineral leases that may encumber the property

### Step 4: Order a Current Survey

Don't rely on an old survey. Property corners move (fence lines drift, monuments disappear), and a current survey from a licensed surveyor will confirm:

- Exact acreage and boundaries
- Location of easements crossing the property
- Any encroachments from neighboring parcels
- Flood plain boundaries (FEMA FIRM maps can be outdated)

Cost: $500–$2,500 depending on acreage and terrain.

### Step 5: Verify Utilities Availability

Rural properties often lack one or more municipal utilities. You need to know the status of each before buying:

| Utility | What to Verify |
|---|---|
| Water | Existing well depth/output, or cost to drill |
| Sewer | Septic system age/condition, or perc test results |
| Electric | Distance to nearest power line; extension cost |
| Gas | Propane delivery access, or natural gas availability |
| Internet | Starlink eligibility, fixed wireless, or DSL availability |

Electric extension costs run $15,000–$50,000+ per mile depending on terrain and the utility company. Get this number in writing from the utility company before you make an offer.

### Step 6: Check Zoning and Land Use Restrictions

Zoning rules are set at the county level and vary enormously. Just because land is "agricultural" doesn't mean you can build a home on it.

- Contact the county planning department directly
- Ask about the specific zoning designation (AG, A1, A2, RR, etc.)
- Confirm what structures are permitted: primary dwelling, ADU, barn, manufactured home
- Ask about minimum lot size for building, setbacks from property lines, and road setback requirements

Also check for deed restrictions — private covenants placed by previous owners that can restrict use in ways zoning doesn't.

### Step 7: Run a Full Title Search

A title company or real estate attorney should examine the chain of title going back at least 40–60 years. Common rural title issues include:

- Heir property (ownership fractured among many heirs, some of whom may be unknown)
- Back taxes owed on the parcel or adjacent parcels
- Recorded liens from agricultural loans or government programs
- Conservation easements limiting future development
- Utility easements granting right-of-way across the property

Purchase title insurance. It's not optional for rural land.

### Step 8: Evaluate Soil and Environmental Factors

- **Perc test:** Required for septic permitting; confirms the soil can absorb wastewater
- **Flood zone:** Verify FEMA flood zone status; insurance costs in Zone A/AE can be significant
- **Wetlands:** Army Corps of Engineers jurisdiction; building near wetlands requires permits
- **Soil quality:** If farming is a goal, order a USDA NRCS Web Soil Survey for productivity data

### Step 9: Choose the Right Financing

Rural land financing is different from standard mortgages. Options include:

**USDA Loans**
- USDA Section 502 Direct Loan: for primary residences in rural areas, income-qualified
- USDA Section 523: for self-help housing programs
- Not for raw land — only for land with an existing home or simultaneous construction

**Farm Credit System**
- AgriBank, Farm Credit Mid-America, and other FCAs specialize in rural and agricultural lending
- Will finance raw land, farm improvements, and operating expenses
- Often more flexible on appraisals for unique rural properties

**Conventional Land Loans**
- Harder to get — lenders view raw land as higher risk
- Expect 20–30% down payment requirements
- Shorter terms (5–15 years) and higher rates than home loans
- Some local community banks in rural areas are the best source

**Seller Financing**
- More common in rural land sales than suburban
- Negotiate directly with the seller to carry the note
- Often requires a larger down payment (20–30%) but fewer bureaucratic hurdles

### Step 10: Understand the Closing Process Differences

Rural land closings often take longer and encounter more complications:

- Title issues (see Step 7) frequently require curative work before closing
- Survey discrepancies may require re-surveying or boundary line agreements with neighbors
- Lender appraisals can be challenging — comparable sales are scarce in rural markets
- Some counties require a percolation test and septic permit before recording a new deed
- Budget 60–90 days minimum; 120 days for complex transactions

## Red Flags: When to Walk Away

These aren't necessarily deal-killers, but each warrants serious investigation — and some should send you running:

🚩 **No legal road access** — Landlocked parcels require expensive easement negotiations or litigation. Walk away unless the access issue is already being resolved in writing.

🚩 **Mineral rights already severed and leased** — If an active oil, gas, or mining lease is on the property, you could have heavy equipment and road traffic on your land with limited recourse.

🚩 **Heir property** — Multiple heirs who haven't formalized ownership is a title nightmare. Requires a quiet title action before you can get clean title or financing.

🚩 **No perc test results and seller won't allow testing** — This usually means the soil won't perc and the land can't support a conventional septic system.

🚩 **Vague water source ("there's a spring somewhere")** — Springs are not water rights. A spring can dry up or be diverted. Demand documentation.

🚩 **Power extension is 2+ miles away** — At $15,000–$50,000/mile, this could cost more than the land itself. Get the utility company's written estimate.

🚩 **Deed restrictions you haven't fully read** — Some rural properties have restrictions from prior conservation programs that are permanent and run with the land.

🚩 **Seller pressure to waive due diligence periods** — Legitimate sellers understand that rural land takes time to vet. Pressure to rush is a red flag.

## Questions to Ask Before Making an Offer

- Is there legal, recorded road access? May I see the easement?
- Are mineral rights included in the sale? Are there active leases?
- What is the water source? If a well, what is the depth and GPM output?
- What septic system exists, and when was it last inspected/pumped?
- What is the distance to the nearest power line?
- What is the county zoning designation, and can a primary residence be built?
- Have any government programs (CRP, conservation easements) encumbered this land?
- What taxes are currently owed? Are there any special assessments?
- Has the property ever flooded?
- Why is the seller selling?

## Cost Summary: Rural Land Due Diligence Budget

| Item | Typical Cost |
|---|---|
| Land survey (boundary) | $500–$2,500 |
| Perc test | $300–$800 |
| Water well test (existing well) | $200–$500 |
| Title search and insurance | $500–$1,500 |
| Environmental assessment (Phase I) | $1,500–$3,500 |
| Real estate attorney review | $500–$2,000 |
| **Total due diligence budget** | **$3,500–$10,000+** |

This is money well spent. The cost of discovering a problem after closing is always higher.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I get a mortgage to buy raw rural land?**
A: Yes, but options are more limited than for a home purchase. Farm Credit institutions, USDA programs, and local community banks are the most common sources. Expect 20–30% down for raw land and higher interest rates than a residential mortgage.

**Q: What does "landlocked property" mean?**
A: A landlocked parcel has no legal road access to a public road. The owner can only reach it by crossing someone else's land, which requires a legal easement. Buying landlocked property without a recorded easement in place is extremely high risk.

**Q: Do I need a real estate agent to buy rural land?**
A: Not legally, but a buyer's agent who specializes in rural or agricultural land is worth the cost. They know local customs, can identify due diligence issues, and can negotiate on your behalf. General residential agents often lack the expertise for rural transactions.

**Q: What is a conservation easement and should I worry about it?**
A: A conservation easement is a legal agreement that permanently restricts certain uses of land (usually development) to protect conservation values. It runs with the land — meaning it binds you and future owners. Some are fine (you still get to live there and farm). Others are very restrictive. Always read the easement document in full before buying.

**Q: How do I check if a property is in a flood zone?**
A: The FEMA Flood Map Service Center at msc.fema.gov allows you to search any property address for its flood zone designation. Zone X is generally low risk; zones A, AE, and V carry mandatory flood insurance requirements for federally-backed loans.

**Q: What's a perc test and why does it matter?**
A: A percolation test measures how quickly water drains through the soil — which determines whether the soil can support a septic system. Most counties require passing perc results before issuing a septic permit. If land doesn't perc, you may not be able to build a conventional home on it.

**Q: How long does it take to buy rural land?**
A: Plan for 60–90 days minimum. Title issues, survey work, perc testing, and lender appraisals all take time. Complex transactions with title defects or survey disputes can take 4–6 months.

**Q: Are USDA loans available for buying raw land?**
A: Standard USDA home loans (Section 502) are for homes in rural areas, not raw land. The USDA Farm Service Agency (FSA) has separate programs for agricultural land. Farm Credit lenders are typically the best source for raw rural land financing.
