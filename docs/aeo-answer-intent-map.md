## How to Read This

Each query cluster lists:
- **Who's winning** — sites AI will likely cite right now
- **Gap score** — how open the opportunity is (🟢 wide open / 🟡 contested / 🔴 hard to break in)
- **RHG opportunity** — what to build

---

## Cluster 1: Buying Rural Land (Pre-Purchase)

**Queries:**
- "What should I know before buying rural land?"
- "How to buy rural property checklist"
- "Questions to ask before buying rural land"

**Who's winning:**
- `network.land.com` — 10 Things You Should Know
- `findfarmcredit.com` — 10-Step Checklist
- `agwestfc.com` — Land Buying Checklist
- `rethinkrural.raydientrural.com` — 20 Questions
- `myfcsfinancial.com` — 10 Points to Consider

**Pattern:** Entirely dominated by Farm Credit lending institutions and land broker networks. Every result is either a financial institution trying to originate loans or a brokerage trying to generate leads. No independent, buyer-first voice exists.

**Gap score:** 🟢 Wide open

**RHG opportunity:** `/guides/buying-rural-land-complete-guide-2026` — a genuine buyer's-first checklist that covers the full picture (not just what a lender wants you to think about).

---

## Cluster 2: Rural Internet Options

**Queries:**
- "Best internet options for rural homes 2025/2026"
- "Is Starlink worth it for rural homes?"
- "Starlink vs fixed wireless rural internet"

**Who's winning:**
- `cnet.com` — Best Rural Internet Providers 2026
- `broadbandnow.com` — Satellite vs DSL vs 5G
- `forbes.com/advisor` — Best Rural Internet Providers
- `allconnect.com` — Starlink, T-Mobile, Verizon
- `pcmag.com` — Starlink review

**Pattern:** Dominated by big tech comparison sites (CNET, Forbes, PCMag). They're comprehensive on specs but write for a general audience. None of them frame this from the perspective of "I'm buying a rural home — what do I actually need to know about internet before I buy?"

**Gap score:** 🟡 Contested, but beatable with the right angle

**RHG opportunity:** `/guides/rural-internet-options-buyers-guide` framed as "What to know about internet BEFORE buying rural property" — a question none of the tech sites answer. Cover: checking coverage maps, negotiating with sellers, install costs, what speed you actually need, backup options.

---

## Cluster 3: Well Water

**Queries:**
- "How does well water work for rural homes?"
- "What to know about buying a house with a well"
- "Well water maintenance rural home"

**Who's winning:**
- `rocketmortgage.com` — Buying a house with well water
- `aquasana.com` — How does well water work?
- `carrollwater.com` — Understanding well water in your new home
- `capstonereps.com` — How does a well work for a home?

**Pattern:** Mortgage companies (Rocket), water filter sellers (Aquasana), and a random real estate company. Nobody owns this topic in a comprehensive way. No "complete well water guide for rural homeowners" exists.

**Gap score:** 🟢 Wide open

**RHG opportunity:** `/guides/rural-well-water-complete-guide` — well types, pump systems, pressure tanks, water testing, common problems, maintenance schedule, cost estimates.

---

## Cluster 4: Septic Systems

**Queries:**
- "How does a septic system work rural property?"
- "Septic system maintenance checklist"
- "What to know about buying a house with a septic system"

**Who's winning:**
- `farmcrediteast.com` — Septic System Basics
- `premiertechaqua.com` — What is a septic system?
- `caes.uga.edu` (UGA Extension) — Beginner's Guide to Septic
- `uchuntingproperties.com` — Rural Living Septic 101

**Pattern:** Agricultural credit, water treatment vendors, and university extension sites. The UGA Extension result is high-quality but dense/academic. No consumer-friendly, practical guide from a rural homeowner's perspective.

**Gap score:** 🟢 Wide open

**RHG opportunity:** `/guides/septic-systems-rural-homeowner-guide` — how it works, how to maintain it, pumping schedule, signs of failure, cost to repair/replace, what to inspect before buying.

---

## Cluster 5: USDA Loans

**Queries:**
- "USDA rural home loan requirements 2025"
- "How to qualify for a USDA loan"
- "USDA loan eligibility rural property"

**Who's winning:**
- `rd.usda.gov` — The source of truth (government)
- `amerisave.com` — USDA Eligibility Map Guide
- `admortgage.com` — USDA Loan Eligibility Requirements

**Pattern:** Government + mortgage lenders. Hard to beat on authority. However, these sites are either bureaucratic (USDA) or have obvious sales intent (lenders).

**Gap score:** 🔴 Hard to rank above USDA.gov, but linkable

**RHG opportunity:** Don't try to own this — write a clear, readable explainer that links to the government tools and cites the lenders. Become the "plain English guide to USDA loans" that AI cites alongside the official source.

---

## Cluster 6: Off-Grid Solar

**Queries:**
- "Off-grid solar system for rural home cost"
- "How to go off-grid with solar rural property"
- "Solar panels rural home setup"

**Who's winning:**
- `thisoldhouse.com` — Off-Grid Solar System Cost 2026
- `energysage.com` — Off-Grid Solar Guide
- `forbes.com` — Off-Grid Solar System Cost
- `reddit.com/r/OffGrid` — Real user discussions

**Pattern:** Big home improvement/energy sites + Reddit. Reddit is very strong here because people want real-world cost experiences, not marketing estimates. The official sites give ranges ($45K–$115K) but Reddit gives "here's what I actually paid and what went wrong."

**Gap score:** 🟡 Contestable with real-world angles

**RHG opportunity:** `/guides/solar-power-rural-home-guide` — written from a homeowner perspective. Include real cost ranges by system size, grid-tied vs off-grid tradeoffs, what to ask contractors, battery backup sizing. Link to real Reddit threads as references (AI will trust the citation loop).

---

## Cluster 7: Rural Zoning & Building Permits

**Queries:**
- "Rural zoning laws building permit requirements"
- "Can I build on agricultural land?"
- "What permits do I need for a rural home?"

**Who's winning:**
- `millmanland.com` — Rural Zoning: What to Know About Building
- State/county government sites (fragmented, state-specific)
- `mrsc.org` (Washington State municipal research)

**Pattern:** Extremely fragmented. No national guide exists. Mostly state-specific government or law firm sites. This is because zoning is genuinely county-by-county — which is actually an opportunity for RHG to be the "here's how to research this for YOUR county" guide.

**Gap score:** 🟢 Wide open (with the right angle)

**RHG opportunity:** `/guides/rural-zoning-permits-guide` — not "here are the rules" (impossible nationally) but "here's how to research zoning for any rural property" — who to call, what to ask, what terms mean, how to find your county's GIS zoning map.

---

## Cluster 8: Rural Cost of Living

**Queries:**
- "Cost of living rural vs suburban comparison"
- "Is it cheaper to live in a rural area?"
- "True cost of rural living hidden expenses"

**Who's winning:**
- `nationaldebtrelief.com` — Urban vs. Rural Living 2025
- `newhomesource.com` — 9 Benefits of Rural and Suburban Housing
- `reddit.com/r/Frugal` — Real discussions
- `wealthmeta.com` — Rural vs Urban budgets

**Pattern:** Financial/debt sites (not rural specialists) and Reddit. The financial sites quote stats but miss the hidden costs of rural living (fuel, maintenance, longer drives to everything). Reddit is where the real nuance lives.

**Gap score:** 🟢 Wide open

**RHG opportunity:** `/guides/true-cost-of-rural-living` — the honest math. Not just "housing is cheaper" but the full picture: lower mortgage but higher fuel, well/septic maintenance, propane costs, longer supply runs, volunteer fire district costs, etc. Nobody has written this as a balanced guide.

---

## Cluster 9: Moving from City to Rural

**Queries:**
- "Moving from city to rural what to expect"
- "What surprised me about moving to the country"
- "Rural living reality check"

**Who's winning:**
- `mastermoversmovingcompany.com` — Pros and Cons (a moving company!)
- `safeshipmoving.com` — Moving from Urban to Rural
- `reddit.com/r/Frugal` — Community discussions
- `buzzfeed.com` — Culture shock stories

**Pattern:** Moving companies with no real expertise + BuzzFeed listicles + Reddit. This is one of the weakest-covered topics in the entire rural space. The audience asking this question is your exact target reader.

**Gap score:** 🟢 Wide open

**RHG opportunity:** `/guides/moving-from-city-to-rural-survival-guide` — the honest, practical guide covering mindset shifts, logistics surprises, what to research before you move, community integration, remote work reality. This is the single highest-intent query that has no good answer right now.

---

## Cluster 10: Water Rights & Mineral Rights

**Queries:**
- "Water rights mineral rights rural land purchase"
- "Do I own water rights on my land?"
- "How to check mineral rights before buying land"

**Who's winning:**
- `haydenoutdoors.com` — Surface Rights vs Mineral Rights
- `squarefootproductions.com` — Water and Mineral Rights
- `reddit.com/r/homestead` — Community discussions

**Pattern:** Niche land/hunting sites and Reddit. Very fragmented. The topic is genuinely complex and state-specific, but there's no "Mineral Rights 101 for the rural home buyer" guide.

**Gap score:** 🟢 Wide open

**RHG opportunity:** `/guides/water-rights-mineral-rights-rural-buyer-guide` — a primer that explains what to look for, how to read a deed for rights separation, what questions to ask your title company, and why it matters.

---

## Cluster 11: Best States for Rural Property

**Queries:**
- "Best states to buy rural property 2025"
- "Where to buy cheap rural land in the US"
- "Most affordable states for rural living"

**Who's winning:**
- `buyheritage.com` — Top States for Affordable Land
- `apxnproperty.com` — Top 10 Best States to Buy Land
- `mwranches.com` — Cheapest Rural Land State-by-State
- `landhub.com` — Top States for Recreational Land

**Pattern:** Land brokers and investment sites. All have obvious "buy through us" intent. No neutral, lifestyle-focused guide exists.

**Gap score:** 🟡 Contested

**RHG opportunity:** `/guides/best-states-for-rural-living-2026` framed around lifestyle (not just price per acre) — broadband access, property taxes, water availability, building codes, community, climate. A different angle than what exists.

---

## Cluster 12: Rural Home Maintenance

**Queries:**
- "Rural home maintenance checklist annual"
- "Well and septic maintenance schedule"
- "What maintenance does a rural home need?"

**Who's winning:**
- `dstreetbrokers.com` — Well and Septic Maintenance Basics (local broker)
- `albertatownandcountry.com` — Septic & Well Inspection Checklist
- `baymgmtgroup.com` — Property management company
- `ihs.gov` — Government septic guide (PDF)

**Pattern:** Extremely fragmented. Local real estate brokers, random property management companies, government PDFs. Nobody owns "comprehensive rural home maintenance guide."

**Gap score:** 🟢 Wide open

**RHG opportunity:** `/guides/rural-home-annual-maintenance-checklist` — a proper, seasonal checklist covering well, septic, propane, generator, driveway, roof, wood stove, water heater. This doesn't exist in a good format anywhere.

---

## Cluster 13: Propane Heating

**Queries:**
- "Propane vs electric heating rural home"
- "How much does propane heating cost rural home"
- "Rural home heating options comparison"

**Who's winning:**
- `hopenergy.com` — Propane vs Electric cost comparison
- `thomasbrospropane.com` — Propane vs Electric
- `ferrellgas.com` — Propane vs Electric Heat

**Pattern:** Propane companies writing about propane. Obvious bias. No neutral comparison from a rural homeowner perspective.

**Gap score:** 🟢 Wide open

**RHG opportunity:** `/guides/rural-home-heating-options-guide` — propane vs electric vs wood vs oil vs geothermal, written neutrally from a "what's right for your situation" lens.

---

## Cluster 14: Homesteading Basics

**Queries:**
- "Rural homesteading for beginners"
- "How to start a homestead from scratch"
- "Beginner homesteading skills to learn"

**Who's winning:**
- `homestead.org` — The Beginner's Guide to Becoming a Homesteader
- `lifeatcobblehillfarm.com` — Personal blog, good content
- `grocycle.com` — How to Start a Homestead
- `azurefarmlife.com` — Three Principles for Beginners

**Pattern:** Personal blogs and a dedicated homesteading site (homestead.org). This is the most competitive cluster for RHG because niche blogs with real lived experience are strong here. But most of these are old content (2023 and before).

**Gap score:** 🟡 Contested

**RHG opportunity:** `/guides/homesteading-beginners-guide-2026` updated with current costs, modern off-grid tech (Starlink, battery storage), and linking to RHG's infrastructure guides (well, septic, solar). The differentiation is positioning homesteading within the context of rural property ownership, not just farming.

---

## Cluster 15: Rural Land as Investment

**Queries:**
- "Is buying rural land a good investment?"
- "Rural land appreciation 2025"
- "Rural property investment pros and cons"

**Who's winning:**
- `apxnproperty.com` — Top 6 Benefits of Rural Land Investment
- `ers.usda.gov` — Farmland value data (authoritative)
- `swanlandco.com` — 2025 Land Market Outlook
- `discountlandinvesting.com` — How land appreciates

**Pattern:** Land investment companies + USDA data. Nobody has written a neutral "here's how to think about rural land as an investment" guide for the regular person.

**Gap score:** 🟡 Contestable

**RHG opportunity:** `/guides/buying-rural-land-as-investment` — covers appreciation data, carrying costs, income potential (lease, timber, mineral), liquidity risks, and how to evaluate a property financially. Cite USDA data as a source (AI will respect that citation chain).

---

## Summary: The Big Picture

### Who RHG is NOT competing against
- `land.com` / `landhub.com` — land marketplaces (you're not listing properties)
- `rd.usda.gov` — government (you don't compete with the source)
- `cnet.com` / `forbes.com` — for pure tech/internet comparisons

### Who RHG IS competing against (and can beat)
- Farm credit institution blogs (financial bias, not buyer-first)
- Moving company articles (no real expertise)
- Random local broker posts (local, not comprehensive)
- Reddit threads (unstructured, no single citable source)
- Personal homesteading blogs (excellent content but not structured for AI citation)

### The Core Gap
There is **no single, trusted, independent voice** for rural homeownership the way Investopedia owns personal finance, NerdWallet owns credit cards, or Healthline owns consumer health. That's the position RHG should build toward.
