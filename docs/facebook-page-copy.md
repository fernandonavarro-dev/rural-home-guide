> Rural Home Guide is the resource we wish had existed when we bought rural property.

>
> Real answers. No link farms. No decade-old PDFs.
>
> Site launches soon at ruralhomeguide.com — follow the page to be the first to know.

## Cover Photo Notes
Suggested visual direction:
- **Tone:** Earthy, trustworthy, rural — not "farmhouse aesthetic", more practical/honest
- **Colors:** Match the site palette — warm cream (`#F7F4EE`), deep forest green (`#1A3A0F`), amber (`#C4860A`)
- **Content:** Could be a wide shot of rural property (field, fence, farmhouse) with the logo/tagline overlaid
- **Dimensions:** 820 × 312px (desktop) / ensure focal point is centered for mobile crop (820 × 182px safe zone)
- **Text overlay:** "The complete guide to rural homeownership." in Georgia serif

## Profile Photo

- Fallback: a clean green square with "RHG" in white Georgia serif
- Dimensions: 170 × 170px (displays at 36 × 36px in feed — keep it simple and legible)
