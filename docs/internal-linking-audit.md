# Internal Linking Audit — Rural Home Guide

_Completed: 2026-03-01_

This document records the state of internal linking across all published guides as of the audit date, what links were added, and remaining opportunities.

## Summary: Pre-Audit State

### Links That Already Existed (Related Guides sections)

Each article had a "Related Guides" section at the bottom linking to several other guides. These were mostly comprehensive but lived only in the footer section — not embedded in the body text where they'd be most contextually relevant.

| Article | Internal Links in Related Guides (pre-audit) | Inline Body Links (pre-audit) |
|---|---|---|
| buying-rural-land-complete-guide | rural-utilities, rural-zoning, true-cost, maintenance-checklist, rural-internet | None |
| moving-from-city-to-rural-guide | true-cost, rural-utilities, rural-internet, buying-rural-land, maintenance-checklist | `/guides/true-cost-of-rural-living` (1 inline, in FAQ) |
| rural-home-annual-maintenance-checklist | rural-utilities, true-cost, moving-from-city, buying-rural-land, rural-zoning | None |
| rural-internet-options-guide | rural-utilities, moving-from-city, true-cost, buying-rural-land | `/guides/rural-internet-options-guide` (linked from utilities guide body) |
| rural-utilities-complete-guide | buying-rural-land, rural-internet, true-cost, maintenance-checklist, rural-zoning | `/guides/rural-internet-options-guide` (1 inline, in Internet section) |
| rural-zoning-permits-guide | buying-rural-land, rural-utilities, maintenance-checklist, true-cost | None |
| true-cost-of-rural-living | moving-from-city, rural-utilities, rural-internet, buying-rural-land, maintenance-checklist | None |

**Key gap before this audit:** No article linked to `private-well-101` (it didn't exist). Also, most articles had zero inline contextual links — all linking was confined to "Related Guides" footer sections.

## What Was Added in This Audit

### 1. `buying-rural-land-complete-guide.mdx`

**Added:** Inline link to `/guides/private-well-101` in the **Step 2: Research Water Rights** section.

**Context:** After explaining water rights and the importance of verifying existing wells, the new text reads: *"If the property has an existing well, verify its depth, pump age, and last water quality test date — and order a fresh water test before closing. Our Private Well 101 guide explains exactly what to test for and how to evaluate the system you're buying."*

**Why it fits:** Buyers doing well due diligence need exactly this resource. Natural and high-value placement.

---

### 2. `moving-from-city-to-rural-guide.mdx`

**Added:** Inline links to `/guides/private-well-101` and `/guides/rural-utilities-complete-guide` in the **"You Are Now Responsible for Your Infrastructure"** section.

**Context:** After establishing that the reader now owns the well and septic system, the new text recommends Private Well 101 for first-time well owners and the Rural Utilities Complete Guide for the full picture.

**Why it fits:** This is the exact moment a city-to-rural mover needs to know where to learn more. High-intent, high-relevance placement.

---

### 3. `rural-home-annual-maintenance-checklist.mdx`

**Added two links** to `/guides/private-well-101`:

1. After the **Annual Well Water Quality Testing** task: *"For a full breakdown of what to test for, how to read results, and where to send samples, see the Private Well 101 guide."*

2. After the **Wellhead Inspection** task in Spring maintenance: *"Not sure what to look for at the wellhead, or how your well system works? Our Private Well 101 guide walks through the anatomy of a drilled well, warning signs, and what you can check yourself versus when to call a pro."*

**Why it fits:** The maintenance checklist tells people *what* to do; Private Well 101 tells them *how* and *why*. These two articles complement each other directly. The maintenance checklist is likely to be the first place new owners look — making it a high-value funnel point.

---

### 4. `rural-utilities-complete-guide.mdx`

**Added:** Inline link to `/guides/private-well-101` at the top of the **System 1: Well Water** section.

**Context:** New introductory sentence: *"This section gives you a working overview of private well systems. For a full deep-dive — including pump types, water testing protocols, warning signs, and maintenance details — see our dedicated Private Well 101 guide."*

**Why it fits:** The utilities guide covers wells at a summary level. Private Well 101 is the dedicated pillar article. This creates a clean hub-and-spoke relationship between the two articles.

---

### 5. `rural-zoning-permits-guide.mdx`

**Added:** Inline link to `/guides/private-well-101` in the **Step 4 / Well Permit** section.

**Context:** After explaining well permits, the new text reads: *"If you're buying a property with an existing well or planning to drill one, our Private Well 101 guide covers well system anatomy, costs, water testing, and what to verify before closing."*

**Why it fits:** Someone researching well permits is often a buyer or builder — exactly the audience for Private Well 101.

---

### 6. `true-cost-of-rural-living.mdx`

**Added two links:**

1. Inline link to `/guides/private-well-101` in the **Well and Septic Maintenance** section, before the cost table.

2. Inline link to `/guides/rural-home-annual-maintenance-checklist` in the **What to Budget Before You Move** section intro.

**Context for link 1:** *"For a full breakdown of what well ownership involves — pump systems, testing, maintenance, and failure costs — see our Private Well 101 guide."*

**Context for link 2:** *"For the full list of recurring annual maintenance tasks and their cost ranges, see the Rural Home Annual Maintenance Checklist."*

**Why it fits:** The true cost guide is a financial overview — it summarizes costs without deep operational detail. Private Well 101 is the right destination for readers who want to understand what they're paying for. The maintenance checklist link adds immediate practical utility to the budget section.

---

### 7. `rural-internet-options-guide.mdx`

**Added:** Inline link to `/guides/rural-utilities-complete-guide` in the **Why Internet Access Is Now a Rural Utility** intro section.

**Context:** After advising readers to verify internet with the same diligence as water and sewer, the new text reads: *"For guidance on researching the full suite of rural utilities — well water, septic, power, and internet together — see the Rural Utilities Complete Guide."*

**Why it fits:** The internet guide is a standalone deep-dive on one utility. Pointing readers to the full utilities picture for property evaluation is a natural next step. Keeps the reader in the site ecosystem.

## Remaining Opportunities (Not Added — Would Be Forced)

These links make topical sense but were not added because the placement would feel awkward or manufactured:

1. **rural-internet-options-guide → private-well-101**: The internet guide is entirely about connectivity; inserting a well water link in the body would feel out of place. The Related Guides section is sufficient.

2. **rural-zoning-permits-guide → buying-rural-land-complete-guide (inline)**: The zoning guide already cross-links to the land buying guide in Related Guides. Adding an inline mention would duplicate without adding value.

3. **rural-home-annual-maintenance-checklist → rural-zoning-permits-guide (inline)**: Maintenance and zoning are adjacent topics but don't have strong connective tissue in the body text. Footer link is sufficient.

4. **buying-rural-land-complete-guide → moving-from-city-to-rural-guide (inline)**: The land buying guide is about purchase due diligence; the city-to-rural guide is post-purchase lifestyle. Related Guides coverage is appropriate; an inline link would interrupt the flow.

5. **true-cost-of-rural-living → rural-internet-options-guide (inline)**: True cost already covers internet costs and links to the internet guide in Related Guides. An additional inline link in the internet cost section would be redundant.

## Recommendations for Future Articles

1. **As new pillar articles are created** (well water testing, well pump troubleshooting, well filtration, septic system 101, etc.), run an incremental audit. Specifically check: the maintenance checklist, the utilities guide, and the true cost guide for natural insertion points.

2. **Develop inline linking as a first-class habit** — Related Guides sections are table stakes. High-value contextual links in the body text (placed at the moment of highest reader intent) should be standard practice for every article published.

3. **Consider a "In this pillar" widget or component** for the Wells category. Private Well 101 → Well Water Testing → Well Pump Troubleshooting → Well Water Filtration is a natural series. Explicit navigation between pillar articles will reduce bounce and increase pages-per-session.

4. **Articles not yet written that will create new linking opportunities:**
   - Septic System 101 (creates links from rural-utilities, maintenance-checklist, true-cost, buying-rural-land)
   - Rural Water Filtration Guide (links from private-well-101, rural-utilities)
   - Rural Home Insurance Guide (links from true-cost, buying-rural-land)
   - Generator Guide (links from rural-utilities, moving-from-city, maintenance-checklist)

5. **The buying-rural-land-complete-guide is a high-traffic entry point** — it currently has the most comprehensive Related Guides section but few inline contextual links. As the content library grows, prioritize adding inline links in that article at the most relevant moments (e.g., link to Septic 101 in the perc test section, link to Rural Internet in the utilities section, etc.).
