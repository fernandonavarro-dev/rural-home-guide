## Content Strategy

**Target reader:** Someone who just bought rural property (or is about to), has never dealt with a well or septic system, and is quietly terrified they're going to screw something up.

**Voice:** Direct, practical, honest. Like advice from the smart neighbor who actually knows this stuff — not a contractor trying to upsell you, not a lawyer covering their bases.

**Format:** Long-form guide (1,500–3,000 words) with clear H2s, bullet takeaways, and a "Bottom line" section. No fluff.

- **Primary keyword strategy:** Target long-tail, question-format queries ("how often should you pump septic tank", "well pump no water")
- **Avoid:** Generic "best X" listicles — focus on *how-to* and *diagnostic* content
- **Internal linking:** Each pillar hub (101 article) links to all sub-articles in that pillar
- **Schema markup:** Add FAQ schema to troubleshooting articles for Google rich snippets
