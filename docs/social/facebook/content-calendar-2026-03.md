### 💡 Monday, March 3 — Well Water Tip
**Type:** Educational Tip  
**Post at:** 10am Central

**Copy:**
```
💧 If you're buying rural property with a well, get the water tested before you close.

Not just a basic potability test — a full panel.

Look for:
• Coliform bacteria
• Nitrates
• Arsenic
• pH and hardness
• Iron and manganese

Many lenders only require a basic test. A full panel runs $100–$200 and tells you what you're actually dealing with.

Worth every dollar.

### 📖 Tuesday, March 4 — Guide Promo: True Cost of Rural Living
**Type:** Guide Promo  
**Post at:** 10am Central

**Copy:**
```
Most people moving to rural property budget for the land and the house.

They don't budget for the well pump that fails in year 3. Or the septic pump-out. Or the propane fill in January. Or the generator when the power goes out for 4 days.

We broke down the real numbers 👇

📖 The True Cost of Rural Living

It's not cheap. But it's worth it — if you go in with eyes open.

### 📖 Thursday, March 6 — Guide Promo: Buying Rural Land
**Type:** Guide Promo  
**Post at:** 10am Central

**Copy:**
```
Buying rural land is nothing like buying a house in the suburbs.

Perc tests. Mineral rights. Flood zones. Well permits. Easements. Septic setbacks. Timber rights.

Most buyers find out about these after they've already made an offer.

We wrote the guide we wish existed 👇

### 📊 Friday, March 7 — Quick Fact
**Type:** Fact  
**Post at:** 10am Central

**Copy:**
```
43 million American households get their water from a private well.

That's more than 1 in 8 homes in the US.

And there is almost no modern, reliable guide for them.

That's what we're building at Rural Home Guide — the resource that should have existed 20 years ago.

### 📖 Monday, March 9 — Guide Promo: Moving from City to Rural
**Type:** Guide Promo  
**Post at:** 10am Central

**Copy:**
```
Moving from the city to a rural property is a lifestyle change, a skills change, and a mindset change.

The things that were someone else's problem (water pressure, sewage, power outages) are now yours.

We put together a survival guide for the transition 👇

The learning curve is real. The payoff is bigger.

### 💡 Tuesday, March 10 — Septic Tip
**Type:** Educational Tip  
**Post at:** 10am Central

**Copy:**
```
🚨 Signs your septic system is telling you something's wrong:

• Slow drains throughout the house (not just one fixture)
• Gurgling sounds in toilets or drains
• Wet, soggy patches in the yard near the drain field
• Sewage smell inside or outside
• Unusually green or lush grass over the septic tank

Any one of these warrants a call to your septic pumper.

All of them at once = emergency.

Most septic systems need pumping every 3–5 years. Don't wait until it's a crisis.

### 📖 Wednesday, March 11 — Guide Promo: Rural Internet
**Type:** Guide Promo  
**Post at:** 10am Central

**Copy:**
```
Internet is the #1 thing people underestimate when moving to rural property.

"The listing said high-speed internet is available."

Available doesn't mean fast. Available doesn't mean reliable. Available doesn't mean it works from your actual address.

We broke down every rural internet option — satellite, fixed wireless, DSL, cellular, Starlink — and what each actually means for you 👇

### 💡 Saturday, March 14 — Spring Prep Tip
**Type:** Educational Tip  
**Post at:** 11am Central

**Copy:**
```
🌱 Spring rural home checklist — quick version:

Well:
✓ Check pressure tank for waterlogging
✓ Inspect well cap for cracks or insect intrusion
✓ Test water (annually is best)

Septic:
✓ Walk the drain field — any wet spots or odors?
✓ When was the last pump-out? Schedule if >3 years

Propane:
✓ Check tank gauge, order before summer fill season ends
✓ Inspect regulator and connections for winter damage

Drainage:
✓ Clear gutters and downspouts
✓ Check grading away from foundation

Takes one afternoon. Worth a full season of peace of mind.
